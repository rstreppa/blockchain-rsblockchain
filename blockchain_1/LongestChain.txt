The rules in practice are this: when a new block arrives, and it extends the previous active chain, 
we just append it to the active chain. 
If not, it depends on whether the branch it extends now has more work than the currently active branch. 
If not, we store the block and stop. 
If it does have more work, we do a so called "reorganisation": deactivating blocks from the old branch, 
and activating blocks from the new branch.


Imagine that the blockchain is 210000 blocks long and TWO miners both find valid blocks 
within a few seconds of each other and broadcast them to the network.
This is perfectly normal as the Bitcoin network is peer to peer and global.
You now have two chains, each of length 210001. Neither of these are longer than each other. 
Some bitcoind nodes will see the first miner's block and some bitcoind nodes will see the second.
Temporarily you have two forks of the blockchain, each of length 210001 blocks long. 
They are identical for 210000 blocks, but the 210001st is different on the two forks.
Sometime later another miner finds another valid block, the 210002nd block, and that will be attached 
to exactly one of the forks.
This chain is now the longest at 210002 blocks and becomes the longest chain. 
It becomes the "definitive" blockchain.
(The transactions in the alternate fork don't disappear - 
they simply get put back into the pool of unconfirmed transactions and 
miners will put them into a subsequent block).
