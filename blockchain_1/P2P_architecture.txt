	the executable runs a node
	each node can run a server side and a client side 
	each node runs 1 thread to constantly update the array of active connections
	each node runs 1 thread to run as a server side
	the first node immediately generates the genesis block in the blockchain
	each node has the capability of making a transaction to each of the other nodes (not self)
	each node has the capability of mining a block
	as soon as a transaction is done or a block is mined a node swithces to client side and 
	communicates to the list of active servers
	the server side receives and stores the transaction into the next block
	the server side receives and validates the newly received block, longest chain rule applies
	the client side broadcasts the transaction(s)
	the client side that mined a block broadcasts its chain
	the node that validated the chain broadcasts it through the client side
	asynchronous calls: client doesn't freeze while waiting for server response
